# Power BI connector for Stripe

This connector is based on work from [SCITYLANA](https://github.com/mbilling/PBIConnectors) but aims to provide more comprehensive solution for fetching data from Stripe.

## Usage

Add `Stripe.pq` file to Power BI Custom Connectors path and restart Power BI to quickly start using the connector:

```
/Documents/Microsoft Power BI Desktop/Custom Connectors/Stripe.pq
```

Visual Studio project is still missing from this repo due to the fact that we have no physical Windows computers at this time and the connector is used on virtual machine only.

## Stripe Api Version

This connector uses api version: `2020-08-27`.
